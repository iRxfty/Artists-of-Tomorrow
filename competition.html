            <h2>Judging Process</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Artwork will undergo a first round of review by the founders to ensure all artwork and writing is aligned with the prompt and appropriate.</li>
                <li>Within this first round, all artwork will be viewed through the scanned copies that are provided.</li>
                <li>Any works/writings that we feel do not align with the prompt or are not appropriate will not proceed to the next round of judging and will be disqualified.</li>
                <li>By entering this competition, you consent to the usage of your art for research/analysis purposes regarding societal/mental patterns of self-expression. Your name will not be recorded.</li>
                <li>Artwork will then proceed to another round of judging by a judge panel consisting of two (maybe three) artists.</li>
                <li>Each judge will assign you a score based on the rubric that is provided.</li>
                <li>The scores will then be totaled. Any ties in scores within the top position will ultimately be decided by the founders with input from the judges.</li>
                <li>Total scores will be used to determine the first, second, and third prize winners. Any other artwork that judges found exemplary, unique or creative in a distinctive manner may be granted an Honorable Mention.</li>
                <li>Winners will be posted on the website, and promptly contacted for more information regarding prize money, certificates and other opportunities.</li>
